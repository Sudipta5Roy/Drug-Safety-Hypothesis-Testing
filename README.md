# Drug-Safety-Hypothesis-Testing
Analyzed drug trial data using Python &amp; statistical tests (Z-test, Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U) to compare adverse effects &amp; age between Drug/Placebo groups. Assessed statistical significance and data distributions. Demonstrated skills in data analysis, hypothesis testing, &amp; interpretation of results.

PROJECT INSTRUCTION
Determine if the proportion of adverse effects differs significantly between the Drug and Placebo groups, saving the p-value as a variable called two_sample_p_value.

Find out if the number of adverse effects is independent of the treatment and control groups, saving as a variable called num_effects_p_value containing a p-value.

Examine if there is a significant difference between the ages of the Drug and Placebo groups, storing the p-value of your test in a variable called age_group_effects_p_value.

HOW TO APPROACH
How to approach the project

Two-sample proportions z-test

Association between adverse effects and the groups

Inspecting whether age is normally distributed

Significant difference between the ages of both groups
